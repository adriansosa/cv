  Iâ€™m a software engineer with a passion for learning new technologies, and how to integrate them into my production stack. Since
  relocating to Denver, CO, I have been working closely with early-stage startups to build software at a rapid pace
  through TDD. After working with T-Mobile for approximately 5 years, I gained a great deal of experience writing high
  performance code intended to run on low powered devices. I have been fortunate in being able to diversify my
  experience and truly fulfill the role of a full stack engineer. From managing the linux kernel deployed on a variety of
  devices, maintaining a web browser, and everything from writing user-space drivers to a React application in the same
  project. I am extremely passionate about my profession in software. In my free time I enjoy writing GoLang, exploring
  machine learning and functional programming, attending information security meet-ups, and hanging out with my Boxer.
